# ActionPiece: Contextual Action Tokenization

This repository provides the code for implementing ActionPiece described in our
**ICML 25 Spotlight** paper "[Contextually Tokenizing Action Sequences forGenerative Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13581)".

Unlike existing generative recommendation (GR) models that tokenize each action
independently, we propose ActionPiece, a method that
**explicitly incorporates context into action sequence tokenization**.
In ActionPiece, each action is initially represented as a set of item features.
Using a corpus of action sequences, we construct a vocabulary by merging
frequently co-occurring feature patterns, both within individual sets and across
adjacent sets.

## Quick start

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py \
    --category=Sports_and_Outdoors
```

Note that:
1. The datasets will be automatically downloaded once the `category` argument is specified.
2. All hyperparameters can be specified via command line arguments. Please refer to:
    * `genrec/default.yaml`
    * `genrec/datasets/AmazonReviews2014/config.yaml`
    * `genrec/models/ActionPiece/config.yaml`

## Reproduction

### Sports and Outdoors

Below are the scripts to reproduce the results reported in our paper.

```bash
for seed in {2024..2028}; do
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py \
        --category=Sports_and_Outdoors \
        --rand_seed=${seed} \
        --weight_decay=0.15 \
        --lr=0.005 \
        --n_hash_buckets=128
done
```

### Beauty

```bash
for seed in {2024..2028}; do
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py \
        --category=Beauty \
        --rand_seed=${seed} \
        --weight_decay=0.15 \
        --lr=0.001 \
        --n_hash_buckets=64
done
```

### CDs and Vinyl

```bash
for seed in {2024..2028}; do
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py \
        --category=CDs_and_Vinyl \
        --rand_seed=${seed} \
        --weight_decay=0.07 \
        --lr=0.001 \
        --d_model=256 \
        --d_ff=2048 \
        --n_hash_buckets=256
done
```

## Locating the code

### Vocabulary construction

* `genrec/models/ActionPiece/core.py` - `ActionPieceCore.train()`

### Segmentation

Set permutation regularization (SPR) during

* **training**: `genrec/models/ActionPiece/tokenizer.py` - `ActionPieceTokenizer.collate_fn_train()`
* **inference**:
    * `genrec/models/ActionPiece/tokenizer.py` - `ActionPieceTokenizer.collate_fn_test()`
    * `genrec/models/ActionPiece/model.py` - `ActionPiece.generate()`

## Tokenizers

After the first run on each dataset, the provided code automatically constructs
and caches the tokenizer vocabulary. The cached tokenizer follows a structure
like:

```json
{
    "n_categories": 5,
    "n_init_feats": 1153,
    "token2feat": [
        [-1, -1], # placeholder
        [0, 0], [0, 1], ...,
        [1, 0], [1, 1], ...,
        [4, 126], [4, 127], # [a, b] denotes the b-th choice of each item's a-th feature
        [-1, 363, 763], [-1, 269, 515], ...,
[-1, 241, 1040], [-1, 30314, 39998] # [-1, u, v] denotes token u and v are merged into a new token
    ],
    "priority": [
        0, 0, ...,
        723.6, 670.04, ...
    ]
}
```
